<br>GPLv2 License<br><br>       GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>                       Version 2, June 1991<br><br> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA<br> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br><br>                            Preamble<br><br>  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>your programs, too.<br><br>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br><br>  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br><br>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>rights.<br><br>  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>distribute and/or modify the software.<br><br>  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>authors' reputations.<br><br>  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br><br>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>modification follow.<br><br>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br><br>  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br><br>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br><br>  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>along with the Program.<br><br>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br><br>  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br><br>    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br><br>    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>    parties under the terms of this License.<br><br>    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br><br>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>collective works based on the Program.<br><br>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>the scope of this License.<br><br>  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br><br>    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>    customarily used for software interchange; or,<br><br>    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>    received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br><br>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>itself accompanies the executable.<br><br>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br><br>  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>parties remain in full compliance.<br><br>  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>the Program or works based on it.<br><br>  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>this License.<br><br>  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br><br>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>circumstances.<br><br>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>impose that choice.<br><br>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br><br>  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br><br>  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>address new problems or concerns.<br><br>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>Foundation.<br><br>  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br><br>                            NO WARRANTY<br><br>  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br><br>  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br><br>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br><br>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br><br>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br><br>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br><br>    &ltone line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.><br>    Copyright (C) &ltyear>  &ltname of author><br><br>    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or<br>    (at your option) any later version.<br><br>    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>    GNU General Public License for more details.<br><br>    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,<br>    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.<br><br>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br><br>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this<br>when it starts in an interactive mode:<br><br>    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author<br>    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br><br>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may<br>be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be<br>mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.<br><br>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your<br>school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if<br>necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:<br><br>  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program<br>  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.<br><br>  &ltsignature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989<br>  Ty Coon, President of Vice<br><br>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>proprietary programs.
